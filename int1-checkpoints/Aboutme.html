<H1> About Me </H1>

<div class=autobiography>
<p>
I, Nathan David, was born on April 5th, 2003 in Redwood City. For the first 3-4 years of my life, it was pretty boring for<br>
me. I really didn't have anything I liked or did, until my dad bought a computer. He started playing the original Starcraft <br>
on it, and my 4 year old mind was instantly captivated by that video game. I was also introduced to Anime,<br>
which explains the wierd cat thing on the bottom  of the page. Ever since then I've been hooked on video games <br>
of any kind. MMO's, FPS', MOBA's, you name it, i've played it. At first, I was only into console games because I couldn't afford<br>
an expensive gaming PC. But as I got older, I managed to buy a PC with saved up allowance. I then discovered programming, coding, <br>
and how experts on it can make over six figures a year easily from just a computer. I decided to enroll in a programming class in my <br>
high school to learn how to code. In just a week, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, which is running this website. If it weren't <br>
for this class, you wouldn't be reading this right now.
