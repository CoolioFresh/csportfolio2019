                Thanks to KhanAcademy and this Project, I am extremely confident typing code.
                I now know how to organize massive amounts of text and make a simple website using HTML.
                I also now know how to use CSS to my advantage by using it to style my websites and make it look
                better. Thanks to my learning platforms, I know how to color text and add borders to make my
                websites more aesthetically pleasing. I also learned how to make tables using different tags and
                angle brackets. Finally, I know how to use divs to seperate different types of code for styling. All these
                skills has even helped me in other classes. I used my knowledge of code in entrepreneurship class by making
                a website for my business. HTML is truely helpful in my day to day life. On the left, there is the code of this page
