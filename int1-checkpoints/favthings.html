<p>Video Games were first made in the late 1950s, and since then, has captivated the minds of kids and young adults. <br>
These days, there are many types of genres of video games and many game companies making them. The pictures up <br>
above are of World of Warcraft, one of the worlds most popular MMO game, and Steam, a popular game <br>
platform for PC. WoW (World of Warcraft) is one of the first computer games I've ever played and I still play it 
to this day.<br> </p>

<p>The Sneaker culture was started when NBA star Micheal Jordan partnered with Nike to create shoes called "Air Jordans." <br>
Ever since the first Air Jordan shoe was released, they've been popular with people around the globe who were inspired by <br>
Micheal's skill. The picture above is the iconic "Jumpman," which has become synonymous with Jordan. Today, some Air Jordans <br>
sell out in seconds in several different stores. In fact, Jordan has made more money from his merchandise than his entire career<br>
in the NBA.</p> <br>
