            <font size="5"> The main choices I made when creating this website were honestly mainly style choices.
            The main stlye choice was the background, its the first thing people see when they get 
            in the website, which is why I chose a starry night. I specifically chose that because 
            I am a big fan of both Star Trek and Star Wars so a night with stars was an obvious choice.
            The technology of Star Trek made me want to pursue coding and computer science so it is 
            extremely important that I add it. Another choice I made was adding boxes and borders to it. 
            I wanted to make the text easy to read because its on top of the GIF background which might make
            it hard to read. I also added borders to add a sense of order, neatness, and formalness that I really like. The
            last and final choice I made was the colors of the text and borders. I chose to make them black and 
            white because they are one of my favorite colors and it makes the website simple to read and understand.
            I also didn't want reader to have an epilepsy attack while reading which is why I didn't add overwhelming 
            and bright colors to it. On the left, there is a picture of the code making all the decisions for the color, borders,
            and boxes in the website.
